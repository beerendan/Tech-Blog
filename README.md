# MVC Tech Blog

  ## Description
This is a basic blog type website that allows a user to sign up, have their information and encrypted password saved to allow log-in at a later date and be logged after the session has expired. When the page is visited, a user can view existing blogposts made by other users, but must log in to make their own. Once logged in, they can visit the dashboard to view all the posts they've made, with the option to  delete the posts they've made. When they're done, they simply click the log out button to end their session.
